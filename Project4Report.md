# CS180 - Project 4 Report

## Part One: The Project and its Functionality



## Part Two: Individual Section

### Owen Willis
My main contribution to project 4 was the Market class.  This is where the main method that ran the market interface was.  Users are prompted to enter a Username or create an account.  From there the main method splits into different interfaces depending on whether the user is a buyer or a seller.  Buyers can view the products in the market and buy or add items to their cart.  Sellers can view their products, stores, and sales.   All information that is input or output within the main method is either read from or saved to the database through CSV (or table) files.  All quires to the database were done through the main method, although these were mainly contributions made by my teammates.  My responsibility was integrating all the classes created by my teammates into a functioning program that responds based on user input via the terminal.  Additionally, I contributed to one of the subclasses, the Customer class.  The customer class was used to instantiate users within the main method and associate an ID, name, and password with the user.  This information was in turn used to track each users’ cart and purchase history within CSV files.    Outside of the coding aspect, I also helped plan meetings and break up the tasks that needed completion for project 4.
The only thing I would change if we were to start over again is time management.  Everyone on the team had a lot going on, so it wasn’t anyone’s fault, but starting the project a little earlier and working at a steady pace could have led to a better outcome for the final project.  While the project still represents high effort from every team member, a more concrete schedule or timeline could have reduced stress for team members and made the project seem a bit more manageable.  In terms of coding, I think a little more structure could have been used in the subclasses.  An abstract class or interface for a general “user” could have been implemented to keep the Customer and Seller classes a bit cleaner.
